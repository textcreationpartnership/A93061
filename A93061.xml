            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Such were you both, I can ſpeak of my own knowledge for about this Thirty years, and ſuch you are ſtill: And as it was the higheſt glory of the Higheſt <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of this Land (the glory indeed of her Sexe) ſo it will bee your Ladiſhips to bee <hi>Semper Eaedem,</hi> while ſo many others have to their ſhame, <hi>left their firſt love,</hi> if not <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 4.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Yet truly when I conſider, that as it is the nature of <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> (which takes up one part of this Diſcourſe) like <hi>Hagar</hi> preſently to ſwell, and lift up it ſelf upon the firſt <hi>Conception,</hi> though of a <hi>Bond ſon.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And further, when I conſider the <hi>common vanity,</hi> that I ſay not greater <hi>crime</hi> of this preſent age, as in <hi>Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sermons,</hi> ſo in <hi>Dedicatory Epiſtles,</hi> to over-laſh or break out into exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and exceſſive (and often undue) praiſes of the perſons ſpoken <hi>of</hi> in the one, and ſpoken <hi>to</hi> in the other. I confeſs I was reſolved to chide my Pen, and to lay my hand upon my mouth, remembring that of the Poet,
<q>Haec amat obſcurum—</q>
            </p>
            <p>But when I call to minde again on the other ſide, that even the holy Apoſtles, in their Canonical Epiſtles have ſpent ſome good part of their holy lines in the ample commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe eminent Saints to whom they wrote, as <hi>Paul</hi> in his to <hi>Philemon,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> in that of his to an Honourable Lady, and that other to a meaner <hi>Gaius,</hi> and that they went not behinde the door, as wee ſay, to whiſper, but as on the houſe top, did proclaim the Religious and pious
<pb facs="tcp:170099:4"/> practiſes of thoſe more choice Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to the imitation of others.</p>
            <p>And further, when I conſider again in the ſight of God, that with like truth that may bee aſſerted of both your Ladiſhips, which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> a rare, and not ordinary Teſtimony. <hi>Demetrius hath good report of all men,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">3 Joh. v. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and of the truth it ſelfe, and wee alſo beare Record, and wee know that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord is true.</hi> Or what is recorded of <note place="margin">2 Chron. 31. 20, 21</note> 
               <hi>Hezekiah, Thus did Hezekiah through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Judah, and wrought what was good, and right, and truth before the Lord his God; And in every work that hee began in the ſervice of the houſe of God, and in the Law and Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hee did it with all his heart and proſpered.</hi> And in hope that like uſe might bee made of ſuch examples as of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> forwardneſs, which the holy Apoſtle therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, That your zeal and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs might provoke others.

            <p>And therefore, though many other godly and painful Writers, have directed their writings to the peruſal of the godly and Chriſtian Readers, I have choſe, to recommend this following diſcourſe, to thee, to ſhew thee firſt thy ſelf, and thy own unſafe condition, then to provoke

            <p>I muſt ſay of this diſcourſe, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid once of the Law; <hi>The Law is not</hi>

            <p>What the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> ſay of <hi>Verity,</hi> I may ſay of <hi>Sincerity,</hi> much more; If God, ſay they, were minded to aſſume to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a compoſition of <hi>body and ſoul:</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſay they, <hi>Light</hi> ſhould bee his <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> the <hi>Soul:</hi> I may ſay, if Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or Chriſtianity were to bee ſeen, <hi>light</hi> ſhould bee the <hi>cloathing,</hi> and <hi>ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> the <hi>ſoul:</hi> It is ſo much the life and ſoul of Religion, that take this away from any grace, it withers, yea, becomes null and void, ſo that without ſincerity, <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> is not to bee <hi>acknowledged, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> is to bee <hi>repented</hi> of, <hi>hope</hi> it ſelf were <hi>out of</hi> hope, and <hi>faith</hi> could not <hi>truſt</hi> God, nor God <hi>love</hi> our <hi>charity,</hi> all works were but dead works, and <hi>ſplendid ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What therefore <hi>Janſenius,</hi> that famous Biſhop of <hi>Ipres</hi> ſaid, when asked, which of all the Attributes of God hee did moſt admire: Hee anſwered, his <hi>Truth,</hi> and would often in admiration thereof cry out, <hi>O <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eritas, Veritas!

<pb facs="tcp:170099:18"/> is the higheſt; <hi>(Noahs, Jobs, Aſaes</hi> Attribute) for what were all knowledge, profeſſion, and holineſs it ſelf, without this? Therefore as a learned Doctor late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid in a like caſe, I may ſay in admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſincerity, <hi>vix me contineo quin Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mem, Salve Regina profeſſionum.</hi> In the whole <note place="margin">D.

            <p>Wee had once, our Chronicles tell us, a diſeaſe very infective and deſtructive to the Engliſh called <hi>Morbus,</hi> or <hi>ſudor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glicus,</hi> the Sweating Sickneſs, it raged more among thoſe of this Nation, than any where elſe; there were two <hi>Dukes</hi> died of it; there were alſo two Lord Mayors of <hi>London,</hi> and ſix Aldermen, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it in eight daies ſpace; this is a worſe diſeaſe with which the Engliſh are now tainted, this may bee called <hi>Morbus Anglicus,</hi> too properly: Oh that as God was pleaſed to give a ſtop to that, that wee now have no knowledge of ſuch a diſeaſe, ſo it may pleaſe him to heal the hurt of the daughter of our people, that there may neither bee a <hi>Canaanite in the Land, nor hypocrite in the Church, that the remnant of our Iſrael may not do iniquity,</hi>

            <p>Oh that it may never bee ſaid of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> what <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſaid once of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> going thence, <hi>Relicturus ſum tria magna a tergo ingentem urbem, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens Palatium, ingentem hypocriſim:</hi> So here, <hi>Relicturus ſum ingentem Gentem, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentem urbem, ingentem hypocriſim:</hi> I am leaving a great and warlike people, a great and populous City, and a great deal of hypocriſie, both in City and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>What therefore <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaid once to a Cowardly Lubber, call'd by his name, either change thy Name (I pray thee) or thy manners, either ceaſe to bee a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and continue to bee called by my name, or ceaſe to bee called <hi>Alexander,</hi> and continue a Coward, ſo ſay I, or the Lord rather to thee, Oh <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> either bee ſincere, and bee called by the name of Chriſt, or call thy ſelf by ſome <hi>other name;</hi> if thou wilt not bee ſincere; otherwiſe know as the <hi>Romans</hi> dealt with a degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and vicious ſon, of that famous <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio Affricanus,</hi> (whom they ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned) that they would not ſuffer him to wear his Fathers <hi>Ring</hi> on his hand, which had his Fathers <hi>effigies</hi> engraven on it, becauſe hee had nothing like his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but his name; ſo will Chriſt deale

               <p n="3">3 By means of both theſe, ſhee was vainly and ſinfully lifted up in her own conceit. This was a <hi>baſe and ſhameful Exaltation.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>To Heaven]</hi> Here the height of her Exaltation. <hi>Heaven</hi> is taken ſometimes <hi>litterally,</hi> and <hi>locally.</hi> For the place of Gods Throne, and the ſeat of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:

               <p>So that wee ſee a double ſtate of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum</hi> here, you would think ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170099:24"/> like that of our Saviours, of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi> and <hi>Exaltation,</hi> or deſcent into hell, and aſcent into heaven. But they do <hi>toto coelo differre,</hi> they are moſt extreamly different.</p>
               <p n="1">1 In Chriſts Humiliation went before, and Exaltation followed, hee firſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into hell, after aſcended into heaven. Here is a lifting up to heaven firſt, and a caſting down to hell fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In Chriſts caſe the deſcent into hell, was Allegorical, not Local, but his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent into heaven was Local and Litteral, not Allegorical here, <hi>e contra</hi> the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was Allegorical and Imaginary, but the miſery real and literal.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Chriſts hell was a ſhort hell, leading to an everlaſting heaven; here a ſhort heaven leads to an eternal hell. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore indeed, it is more like to Satans two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold condition, whoſe exaltation went before his deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Hee was really lifted up to heaven by the bounty of his Creator.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Hee was ſinfully lifted up by pride in that ſtate.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Hee kept not his habitation, made but a ſhort ſtay there, having forfeited all.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Then hee was judicially and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently thrown down as lightning into hell, where his eternal abode muſt bee.</p>

               <p> So that gather up all wee have ſaid, and put it together, and wee ſhall have a ſad obſervation put into our hands.

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>How the Hypocrite fails in point of Duty.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are two things I ſhall ſpeak to, in purſuance of this point.
<list>
                     <item>1 Shew what duties an hypocrite is wholly defective in.</item>
                     <item>2 Shew wherein hee differs from a truly godly perſon in the duties which hee doth perform.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 There are ſome duties which no hypocrite doth perform:</p>
               <p>As 1. to ſpeak of <hi>Prayer,</hi> an hypocrite may pray; no hypocrite doth, or can <hi>pray in the Spirit,</hi> or doth watch in prayer, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 15. Eph. 6. 18. Zach. 7. 3. Col. 4. 2.</note> hee may bee long, or loud in prayer, may <hi>weep</hi> poſſibly at prayer, doth not <hi>watch</hi> in prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2 An hypocrite may <hi>ſay</hi> many a prayer, many a <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> or Lords prayer no hypocrite doth ſay <hi>Daniels</hi> prayer, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170099:36"/> put that into his <hi>Liturgy,</hi> without which all prayers are in vain; you may periſh with <hi>Our Father</hi> in your mouth; if you have not <hi>Daniels</hi> prayer in your heart, <hi>viz.</hi> praying <hi>that wee may turn from all our</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>iniquities, and underſtand the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have heard ſome ignorant people ſay ſometime, God give us to pray that <hi>Good prayer,</hi> that God may hear, this is that good prayer, you may pray all manner of prayer and ſupplication, but <hi>if you regard iniquity in your hearts, God will not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 66. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>regard all your prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Though I ſaid an hypocrite may ſay the <hi>Lords prayer,</hi> (and not <hi>Daniels)</hi> hee may huddle it over, I mean, yet no hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite is ſerious in ſaying the Lords prayer; ask him <hi>Philips</hi> queſtion, <hi>But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Act. 8. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>thou what thou readeſt, and doſt thou minde what thou ſayeſt?</hi> And he muſt anſwer, <hi>How can I?</hi> except I had a new heart.</p>
               <p>There are two things wherein hee fails as to the <hi>Lords prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Hee ſeparates the <hi>Concluſion,</hi> or Doxology from the <hi>Preface,</hi> hee ſaith, <hi>Our Father</hi> with all his heart, and is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take acquaintance of God ſo far as to have a <hi>Father in heaven.</hi> But when hee ſhould come to the Doxological con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, hee hath no <hi>Praiſe, Kingdome, power, Glory, Majesty, Dominion,</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to God, hee is better in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170099:36"/> of his duties, worſe in the end; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at prayer, than at praiſes. Now this is the proper work of Saints, yea of heavenly Saints and Angels, to bee full of praiſes, and to cloſe their duties with higheſt admiration of God, and hearts brim full of his excellencies appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
               <p>The ſincere worſhipper is beſt at laſt, hee begins full of ſelf, ends full of God.</p>
               <p>His heart the longer hee hath been at duty, is like the water that hath been over the fire, grows hotter, and hotter, at length it boyls and runs over; the poor narrow veſſel cannot hold it while the fire burns, ſo the godly ſay, their heart hath <hi>burnt within them,</hi> and even boyled over, <note place="margin">Pſal. 45. 1. <hi>Ebullivit cor; &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> their hearts have been in heaven, when in praiſes and admirations of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Hee ſeparates the <hi>Petitions,</hi> an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite may ſay the three laſt Petitions, no hypocrite doth ſay the three firſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions with his ſpirit and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="1">1 An hypocrite may with all his heart ſay <hi>Give mee this day my daily bread;</hi> Give mee Lord, health, peace, plenty; give thy bleſſing to mee, my children, my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, ſtate, ſtock, bleſs my going out, coming in, adventures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here hee <hi>lefts up the voyce, and weeps; Haſt thou no bleſsing for mee? Bleſs mee even mee, Oh my Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:170099:37"/> 2 Hee may pray with all his heart, <hi>Forgive mee my treſpaſſes;</hi> forgive both guilt and puniſhment, reſtore mee to thy favour, as though I had never offended, though hee doth but faintly promiſe to forgive others that treſpaſs againſt him.</p>
               <p n="3">3 He may pray with all his heart, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver mee from evil, i. e.</hi> from the evil one, from Satan, from his hands, malice, miſchief, <hi>Good Lord deliver mee,</hi> but from tentations of Satan, motions to ſin, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of ſin, departure from God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleef, hardneſs of heart, hee prayes not againſt them, hee ſaith but faintly, <hi>Lead us not into temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 But for the three firſt Petitions, hee cannot pray them at all.</p>
               <p n="1">1 To pray that <hi>Gods Name may bee hallowed,</hi> and Gods glory may bee exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in every thing, and take the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his own name, honour, intereſt, peace, comfort, ſo that God may bee <hi>magnified by his life, or death,</hi> what cares hee, this is onely the frame of the truly gracious ſoul, <hi>Father ſave mee from this hour;</hi> but why ſhould I pray to bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from this hour? <hi>Father glorifie thy</hi>

               <p>Thus much for Prayer.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>For hearing:</hi> I will not ſay but an hypocrite may hear much, and often, but hee doth not <hi>take heed how hee hears.</hi> Hee is one of <hi>Ezekiels hearers,</hi> or <hi>comers,</hi> who <note place="margin">Ez. 33. 31, 32.</note> ſay, <hi>Come let us hear what is the word that cometh from the Lord, they come, and ſit, and hear, as my people, but they will not do my words; for with their mouths they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetouſneſs.</hi> But he is none of <hi>Iſaiahs hearers or comers,</hi> who ſay, <hi>Come let us go to the houſe of the Lord, and hee will</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 2. 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>teach us of his wayes, and wee will walk in his pathes.</hi> An hypocrite may bee a great Sermon-hearer, cannot bee called a <hi>Sermon-follower,</hi> hee hath the ear tipt, or the tongue tipt; but hath not as the Prieſts in the day of their Conſecration, and the Leper in the day of his Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, had their ear, and the thumb of <note place="margin">Exod 29. 20. Lev. 14, 14, 17.</note> their right hand, and the great Toe of their right foot, all anointed; to ſhew that not onely the <hi>ear</hi> is to bee conſecrated, but the <hi>hand</hi> with which wee work, and the <hi>foot</hi> with which wee walk, ſhould all bee ſanctified.</p>
               <p>3 I will not ſay but the hypocrite may <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> to ſee what
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170099:39"/> hee can finde in them, and if it may bee to finde eternal life by ſearching them, but no hypocrite doth <hi>ſearch his heart by the Scriptures;</hi> hee doth not take this light, and ſearch, and ſweep this houſe; hee is one of the Jewiſh ſearchers, hee is none of the Berean ſearchers, who ſearched the Scriptures daily to ſee if <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 39 Act. 17. 11</note> 
                  <hi>theſe things were ſo,</hi> ſo in their <hi>books,</hi> and ſo in their <hi>hearts,</hi> and lives.</p>
               <p>The ſincere ſoul ſearcheth firſt how the <hi>Sermon and the Scripture</hi> agree, and then how <hi>his heart and life</hi> agree with the Scripture and Sermon. The hypocrite <hi>cenſures</hi> the Preacher, if hee wander from his <hi>Text,</hi> and his <hi>Doctrine</hi> agree not with his <hi>Text,</hi> or his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> with his <hi>Doctrine;</hi> but hee cenſures not himſelf when his <hi>practice</hi> wanders from Text and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and Uſe too. Hee is very <hi>critical</hi> in hearing, or reading an Author, very <hi>hypocritical</hi> in reading his own heart, and examining his own life; hee notes what unſound <hi>Divinity</hi> is in anothers Sermon, or Book, not what unſound <hi>Christianity</hi> is in his own heart. Hee is as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, more troubled at anothers incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of ſpeech, or impropriety of phraſe, than at his own ſoleciſmes, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, and barbarociſmes in manners.</p>
               <p>4 An hypocrite may (I will grant) <hi>keep his mouth</hi> with all keeping and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but no hypocrite in the world doth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170099:39"/> minde that duty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23. to <hi>keep his heart with all keeping,</hi> to obſerve what ſtuffe is there, and to bee troubled at his own vain, unbeleeving thoughts, and ſinfull imaginations, which are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt trouble and exerciſe of a childe of God to keep his heart clean.</p>
               <p>5 Every hypocrite doth talk of God, no hypocrite doth <hi>walk with God,</hi> ſetting <note place="margin">Gen. 5. 24. &amp; 6. 9</note> God as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>alway before him, hee is continually at my right hand, therefore I ſhall not fall,</hi> Pſal. 16.</p>
               <p>6 No hypocrite hath <hi>his converſation</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20</note> 
                  <hi>in heaven;</hi> hee may have heaven in his <hi>communication,</hi> never in his <hi>converſation;</hi> hee may bee <hi>high minded,</hi> is never <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded,</hi> may bee <hi>heavenly-mouthed,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee heavenly-minded.</p>
               <p>7 Laſtly, No hypocrite can ſay, <hi>Hee doth delight in the Law of God in his inner</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 22</note> 
                  <hi>man,</hi> hee may delight to hear, or read it in many paſſages for the equity and juſtice that is in it; but to delight in it (in the purity, ſpiritualneſs, and latitude of it) and that in the inner man (with all the heart) to like well of the <hi>Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> part of it, <hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Mandatory</hi> part, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> and ſo like the Law well when it rebukes, and convinceth of ſin, and ſhuts up our mouths, this is a rare act of ſincerity. To ſay of the Law in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170099:40"/> every precept, and in every reſpect, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>I conſent to it,</hi> I allow not any <note place="margin">1 Sam, 6. 20 Rom 7. 12.</note> diſobedience againſt it, it is <hi>all holy, and juſt, and good,</hi> argues ſincerity. An hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite may ſay it is holy, and ſo holy, that hee likes it the worſe again, <hi>who can ſtand before this holy Law?</hi> or before this holy Lord, by reaſon of his Law? Hee can ſay alſo, <hi>It is a juſt Law</hi> (too juſt) but hee can ſcarcely finde in his heart to ſay, <hi>It is good.</hi> The <hi>promiſe</hi> is good hee ſaith, but the <hi>Law</hi> hee could wiſh were repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and were made a <hi>dead letter,</hi> for it is to his luſts a <hi>killing letter,</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing curb; and hee deſires with <hi>Iſrael</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 19</note> that hee may never hear more of it, then hee ſhall live again, otherwiſe hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes hee muſt needs dye.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing wherein an hypocrite is tardy in matter of duty different from the godly, is in his <hi>manner</hi> and way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it. Hee falls not ſhort ſo much in the matter, form, expreſſion, meaſure, length, and ſize of his duties, as in the life, holineſs, ſpiritualneſs, and manner of his duties. <hi>Manners</hi> do not only make a <hi>man</hi> as wee ſay (not <hi>Mannors, Means, Lordſhips, Habit, &amp;c.)</hi> but manners make the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> alſo. The <hi>Sio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The firſt failing in this kinde is, that the hypocrite <hi>ruſheth abruptly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedly</hi> upon his duties, no prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>before,</hi> no attention <hi>in,</hi> no reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>after</hi> his duties, hee comes from ſin, to duty, and from duty, to ſin again; as that Strumpet who had been ſeeking God by day at her peace-offerings, at <note place="margin">Prov 7. 14</note> night ſeeks out her wanton Mate; or as <hi>Judas</hi> who came reeking from the High Prieſt into Chriſt his preſence, and from the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> hee goes to the <hi>Table of Devils,</hi> hee returns with his <hi>Sop</hi> to the High Prieſts again, hee can lodge Chriſt and <hi>Belial</hi> both in a bed.

It is never ſo well, ſaid one, as when <hi>Moſes</hi> face ſhines and hee not aware of it. But an hypocrite loſeth the comfort of his duties by applauding himſelf, and for making a holy perfume to <hi>ſmell to,</hi> hee is cut off, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 38.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170099:46"/> It fares with an hypocrite priding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his duties, and looking for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for them, as with that Souldier who caſt himſelf into the Sea to take up <hi>Alexanders</hi> faln Crown, and putting it on his own head while hee preſented it to him, or with the <hi>Amalekites</hi> who <note place="margin">2 Sam. 1. 15 &amp; 4. 12.</note> brought <hi>David Sauls</hi> Crown, or <hi>Baanah</hi> and <hi>Rechab</hi> who brought <hi>Iſhboſheths</hi> head, they all expected great thanks and rewards, but loſt their lives. Hee that will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it, and hee that will bee ſaved by his duties, will bee loſt and undone by them. Wee muſt neither make the <hi>Creed a prayer,</hi> nor a <hi>prayer our Creed.</hi> We read <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 24. that the Prieſts were to waſh after their ſacrifice, as well as before; and wee need the blood of Chriſt to waſh our prayers and tears, as well as our ſins. Say <hi>none but Chriſt.</hi> Wee read again, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 20. That there was to bee a more ſolemn ſanctifying, and reconciling of the holy place, the Tabernacle, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which were reputed holy, and might bee looked upon as what ſhould cleanſe and reconcile them; ſo do wee need the blood of Chriſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile our Altar, Tabernacle, and Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-ſervices, which wee are apt to think are of a reconciling and cleanſing nature.</p>
               <p>To conclude, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaid, As it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170099:47"/> were better for a man to bee the moſt ignorant perſon in the world, to know nothing in matters of Philoſophy, or in any controverſie of Divinity, ſo hee know Chriſt crucified, rather than to have all knowledge, and to bee ignorant of him. So it were better for a man to have no duties or righteouſneſs at all, and have nothing but ſenſe of ſin, and worthleſneſs, and to flye to Chriſt with the Publican, or with the Theef on the Croſs, than to have all duties and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs whatſoever, without any ſenſe of ſin at all, and to bee thereby kept from Chriſt.</p>

Where the Mines of gold, but in the deeps of the earth? The Spring and Mines of Grace lye low in the humble heart. The <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> was <note place="margin">1 King. 6. 2. 20 compared.</note> the loweſt part of the Temple, ten Cubits
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170099:50"/> lower than the body of the Temple, but there was nothing but pure gold to bee ſeen, the very floor was overlaid with gold. The Lord will <hi>hear the humble,</hi> Pſal. 10. 17. <hi>Save the humble,</hi> Job 22. 29. <hi>Give grace to the humble,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 5. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt the humble,</hi> Luke 18. 14.

Oh how fruitful are the Low Vallies! the <note place="margin">Pſal. 65. 13.</note> Vallies are covered with Corn, when the Mountains are covered with ſnow: All the Rivers run among the Vallies, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are ever more dry and barren. Oh how ſafe is the weak Conie in the deep of the Rocks! What ſweet communion had <hi>Elias</hi> with God in the low Cave? How ſweet is the ſmell of the lowly Violet (that hides his head) above a hundred of your gaudy Tulips? The <hi>lowly</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, is the <hi>lovely</hi> Chriſtian. There is no fear of an humble Chriſtian, that hee ſhould ever bee hinderly, and decay. If Satan cannot get thee up to an <hi>high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and tempt thee with pride, hee deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires. This is his bait whereby hee draws the <hi>Novice</hi> and unſetled Chriſtian <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 6.</note> into his ſnare, then hee hath him ſure if hee can bee <hi>puffed up.</hi> They are the high ſteeples that are uſually fired with light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when low Cottages eſcape: The

                  <hi>Chryſostome</hi> hath a remarkable ſaying of Humility.

Yet I ſay when Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>that ſtone cut out of the Mountain</hi> (not the <hi>fifth and laſt,</hi> but the <hi>firſt and laſt</hi> Monarch, and the onely Potentate, as hee is called, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15.) ſhall ſet up his Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the ſoul to the diſturbance of Satans peace, and the dethroning of that Tyrant (and this is properly the work and reign of Chriſt) then hee ſhall ſmite the High Image on his feet, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down every imagination, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted thought, and ſhall not onely <hi>break the Clay, the Iron, and Braſs,</hi> but <hi>the Gold and Silver</hi> alſo <hi>all in peeces, and make them all as the duſt of the Summer-threſhing-floor.</hi> When the loftineſs of man ſhall bee brought down, and <hi>the Lord alone exalted in that day,</hi> Iſaiah 2. 17.</p>

               <p>Wee may ſay of this leſſon as a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man ſaid of the holy Language, many ſtudy it, ſome Schollars underſtand it; <note place="margin">Vines.</note> but there is no Nation, ſcarcely any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that uſeth, and ſpeaketh the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Tongue; ſo many ſtudy this grace of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> ſome Schollars under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, very few uſe it.

They aſſent not to this, nor that, nor tother, hardly any thing, they muſt ſee more reaſon for it firſt. The <hi>Quariſta</hi> hath ſpoyled the <hi>Curriſta,</hi> Chriſt ſhall bee God again, as once <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſaid of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his act in propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to the Senate, if hee pleaſe men well, and his Truths and Scripture ſhall <note place="margin">

               <p>Hee that will not learn at firſt to <hi>deny himſelf,</hi> will too ſoon learn to deny his Lord that bought him, and to doubt of all the <hi>Articles</hi> of his faith, and all things practized ſince the Primitive Church, <hi>The Lords day, Infant-baptiſme, Family-prayers, Singing of Pſalms, the office of a Minister, Doctrine of Election,</hi>

               <p>Sincerity begins in Self-denial, and taking up the Croſs, and ends in ſelf-ſaving, and taking up the Crown; or if you will, ſincerity begins in <hi>ſelf-loathing,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> is carried on in <hi>ſelf-ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-obſerving,</hi> and ends in <hi>ſelf-ſaving,</hi> whereas hypocriſie begins in <hi>ſelf-loving,</hi> is carried on in <hi>ſelf-ſeeking,</hi> and ends in <hi>ſelf-deſtroying.</hi> Hee that loveth his life ſhall loſe it. What hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Naamans</hi> obedience to the Prophets counſel, to go waſh in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and bee clean, but want of Self-denial at firſt? Hee went away puffing and blowing, I expected ſome other matter; when hee had learnt to deny himſelf, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and obey, hee was preſently cured. The mixt multitude, though they ſaw all thoſe ſigns and wonders in <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet not being well grammared in Self-denial, halted, and flinched, and ſtarted, and flung back, and never came to <hi>Canaan;</hi> they diſliked the way, the fare, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Ordinances, and every thing, and ſo periſhed. <hi>Bleſſed is hee that is not offended in mee.</hi> None but a ſelf-denying perſon partakes of this bleſſing. The Timber well ſeaſoned never warps, nor ſhrinkes, the heart well ſeaſoned with this grace, never ſhrinkes neither.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Repentance</hi> is the third Radical <note place="margin">3 Repentance</note>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:170099:52"/> grace, wherein hypocrites fall ſhort. It is that which in this Chapter <hi>Capernaum</hi> was upbraided and challenged with, verſ. 20. <hi>That they repented not.]</hi> Not that they heard, profeſſed, beleeved not. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> found it an eaſier matter <note place="margin">Act. 8. 13. &amp; 22. compared.</note> to beleeve (ſuch a beleef as it was) than to repent. Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> calls upon him to repent after hee beleeved, and told him he was in the gall of bitterneſs, becauſe he repented not; he that beleeveth before he repenteth, muſt repent to purpoſe after ſuch beleeving, or of ſuch beleeving, or periſh in beleeving without repentance. Many deal with the doctrine and practiſe of repentance, as children do with a <hi>hard leſſon,</hi> they skip it, and turn over to an eaſier. The hypocrite can ſin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, beleeve, and ſin; but hee cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and <hi>rent his heart</hi> (ſuch is true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) <note place="margin">Joel 2. 13.</note> and live in ſin when hee hath done. The hypocrite as <hi>Magus</hi> claps a <hi>new faith,</hi> to an <hi>old life;</hi> this is eaſie, but to make all new, and to joyn a new life to new doctrines, and a <hi>new heart, to a new life</hi> (this is repentance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 31.) this asketh more pains, and coſts hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as wee ſay. This is the caſe of many new converts, they long to bee at the <hi>fair havens</hi> of conſolation, but would never touch at the <hi>port of Repentance,</hi> nor ever unlade the ſhip of his burden of ſin, or meet with <hi>contrary winds to drive them</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Act. 27. 4, 7, 8.</note>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:170099:53"/> 
                  <hi>backe, or ſo much as a ſayling ſlowly,</hi> if I may ſo far allude to that Sea-voyage of the Apoſtle, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 4, 7, 8. Wee are in this age all for news and eaſe, a <hi>new</hi> Goſpel, new Truths, an eaſie ſalvation, and the cheap Goſpel is all in all. Like <hi>Naaman,</hi> wee like not to hear of waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <hi>waſhing ſeven times</hi> in <hi>Jordan,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 King. 5. 10, 11</note> hee expected the Prophet ſhould <hi>have prayed, and touched the ſore, and hee ſhould bee healed,</hi> without any pains of his; ſo do many expect Chriſt ſhould make a prayer, and intercede for us, the Spirit of grace ſhould touch the ſore, and free grace do all, and the Father ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce us clean.</p>
               <p>The practical part of Repentance is laid aſide, dead and buried, hence ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny raw, and unſound Chriſtians: Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the deeds of the body, plucking out the right eye, are torn out of the Goſpel: Inſtead of mortifying the deeds of the fleſh, wee mortifie the works, grace, and motions of the Spirit; inſtead of repenting of ſin, wee repent of duty, and repent of Repentance.</p>
               <p>But the Word tells us there is no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to bee preached without repentance, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 15. no remiſſion of ſins to bee promiſed without repentance, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. and that this is as neceſſary as faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 21. yea to bee preached and practiſed before the fiducial appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170099:54"/> principal member, and holds the head to get more nouriſhment to it ſelf firſt, then conveyes to all the fellow-members other holy graces. Faith begins to work ſo ſoon as it begins to bee, works in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, longings, pantings, hungrings, thirſtings, when it is yet <hi>weak;</hi> but as it gets more ſtrength, it undertakes greater works, it works firſt, may bee on a <hi>threat,</hi> then on a <hi>promiſe,</hi> ſome <hi>ſingle</hi> promiſe, afterwards upon all the <hi>bundle</hi> of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, then upon <hi>commands,</hi> then upon all <hi>duties,</hi> at laſt it is able to indure all <hi>trials.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 A working faith, works upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and works it ſelf into him, as the <hi>Cony</hi> works into the <hi>Rock.</hi>

Thoſe deeps of the love of God, and the blood of the Lamb, but theſe are much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken. This is the wages, not the work of faith; the Holy-day work as I may ſay, and not the work-day buſineſs. Faith hath buſineſs for both hands, <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Paſsive</hi> work, as well as <hi>Applicative.</hi> Faith is a ſtout Champion, therefore the Lord ſets it, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>

It muſt <hi>purifie</hi> the heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. as well as <hi>pacifie</hi> it. <hi>Sanctifie,</hi> Act. 26. 18. as well as <hi>juſtifie,</hi> Rom. 5. 1.

It muſt obey, <hi>The obedience of faith,</hi> Rom. 1. 5. and 16. 26. It muſt bee a <hi>ſhield</hi> to quench fiery darts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 16. as well as a <hi>hand</hi> to receive Chriſts bounty. It muſt bee a <hi>Breaſt-plate,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 8. It muſt endure trials, <hi>The trial of your faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 7. wee are to live by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38. <hi>Walk</hi> by it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Receive</hi>

               <p>Such a faith hath ſomewhat to do. This faith no hypocrite can have. His <hi>workleſs</hi> faith is a <hi>worthleſs</hi> faith. The dead faith in the ſoul, is like the <hi>dead flye</hi> in the boxe of ointment mars the whole, <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10. 1.</note> like the <hi>Mare mortuum,</hi> or dead Sea, kills every thing that comes near it, like the dead <hi>firſt born</hi> in the <hi>Egyptians</hi> houſes, filled the whole houſe with mourning: <note place="margin">Ex. 12. 29. 30.</note> In a word, like a <hi>dead image</hi> of Chriſt in ſtone, or wood, which though an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Papiſt may adore, an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proteſtant will caſt out of doors, and aboliſh.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Love</hi> is the ſecond <hi>Nutritive grace,</hi> and <hi>Labour</hi> is his <hi>Character. Love</hi> is the glory of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> and <hi>Labour</hi> the glory of <hi>Love.</hi> But an unſound Profeſſor wants both; hee may have faith, but hee wants love; hee dreams hee loves God, but hee hath no labour in his love. It coſts him little. <hi>The ſpirit of love</hi> is ever the ſpirit <hi>of a ſound minde,</hi> and ſincere Chriſtian. <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 9.</note> Faith is a great ſtrengthner, but love much more; faith makes the firſt union, love the next, and the laſt, and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Faith receives Chriſt; Love roots and grounds in him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. Grows up to him in all things, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 15. Faith
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170099:56"/> makes the <hi>contract,</hi> Love the <hi>conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the conſummation is above any contract.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> are the three principal Graces; but Love is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of the three, Faiths chief work is to <hi>work by love.</hi> Faith and hope are onely for this life, faith for preſent, hope for <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> the future. Love is both for preſent, and future, this life, and that to come: Faith is an <hi>Evangelical</hi> grace.

The <hi>world of the ſaved</hi> (though their number bee great when gathered together of all Kindreds, and Tongues, ſuch as <hi>cannot bee numbred)</hi> compared with theſe is but a Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſme, but a <hi>little world</hi> in compariſon, a world in the world, taken out of the world in groſs, it is but <hi>a ſmall world,</hi> God wot, that <hi>went out after Christ,</hi> a <note place="margin">Rev. 79 <hi>Mundus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vua in mundo pravo, mundus mundus, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundo immun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> Joh. 12. 19 Io. 16. 8</note> ſmall world, or parcel of it, that the Spirit is ſent to convince of ſin, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and Judgement.</p>

               <p>Lay but down this Maxime firſt, That as out of the Ark, ſo out of the Church is no ſalvation, out of Paradiſe no tree of life, which is a clear, and undoubted truth, and within how narrow a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs do wee at firſt clap incloſe ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

               </head>
               <p>BUt our main Uſe whereon we intend to inſiſt and dilate, is to tell you how far a formal Profeſſor, or Hypocrite may go. I have ſometimes ſet down forty ſteps, whereby hee may advance fairly towards heaven, and I thought that fair; but I ſhall ſet you <hi>three Ladders</hi> of twenty rounds apeece, whereby an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite may climb up to heaven, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come there, yet I perceive hee may go much further; for it is much eaſier to ſay where hee may begin, than where to end. Sins of ſcandal have been many times <hi>enumerated,</hi> but the <hi>paces</hi> and ſteps of an hypocrite, and artificial Chriſtian, are hardly to bee traced, and counted. Neither do I enter upon this Diſcourſe, to quench the coal of any true <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> or in any ſort to ſmother the leaſt ſteam of the ſmoaking flax. Far bee it from any Miniſter of the Goſpel <hi>to make ſad any whom God would not have made ſad,</hi> and to bee of the ſpirit of thoſe Diſciples <note place="margin">Ezek. 13. 22.</note> who would call <hi>for fire from heaven</hi> on <note place="margin">Luke 9. 54.</note> thoſe, whom wee are to ſave with fear,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170099:72"/> rather pulling them <hi>out of the fire of hell.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jude v. 23.</note> But wee enter upon this unpleaſant task, with the like affection to that which was <note place="margin">Fuller.

               <p>I remember well when the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was commanded to denounce the <hi>fatal downfal</hi> of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> a heathen City, hee was commanded alſo to take up a ſad <hi>Lamentation for Tyrus;</hi> and ſhall I not much more take up a lamentation for Chriſtians, whoſe riſe and fall are both far greater than hers? <hi>Tyrus</hi> her ſtate for the glory of it, is deſcribed thus by the Prophet, Thou haſt ſaid, <hi>I am of perfect beauty,</hi> Ezek. 27. 3. yea the Lord ſaid of her too, Ezek. 28. <hi>Thou ſealeſt up the Sum, full of wiſdome, and perfect in</hi>

Rev. 21, 19, 20</note> ſtones that were in the High Prieſts breaſt-plate, or in the wall of the <hi>New Jeruſalem)</hi> then hee goes on, <hi>Thou art the anointed Cherub, thou waſt upon the holy</hi>

And Chap. 27. ſhee is deſcribed to bee the moſt famous Mart in the world, where there was a confluence of all the riches and beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities that every Nation did afford; yet at length did this <hi>Anointed Cherub</hi> that was <hi>perfect in beauty,</hi> periſh with all <hi>her precious ſtones,</hi> and all is ſummed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Thy Riches, thy Fayres, thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, thy Mariners, thy Pilots, thy Calkers, the occupiers of thy Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi>

                     <hi>To hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> is a greater ſin than to bee held in error, or unrighteouſneſs through ignorance.

                  <p>As it is more to <hi>do truth,</hi> Joh. 3. 21. than to ſay truth, and to <hi>walk in the truth,</hi> 2 Joh. 4. &amp; 3 Joh. 3, 4. is more than to hold, or profeſs the truth; ſo to do <hi>evill,</hi> is worſe than to hold an ill, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound opinion. <hi>To bee the truth,</hi> was the glory of Chriſt, and wee muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to come as near him as wee can. <hi>I am the truth,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>q. d.</hi> I am all <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 6.</note> truth.</p>

Hee ſees thou art more ſhye of him, though humble and peaceable (if any bee ſuch) than of one openly prophane, where is thy equal hatred of all evill in the mean time? Thou wilt not drink with a man of a different judgement, yet wilt with a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> nor bee conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with a man that holds an odd opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet wilt bee familiar with him that will ſwear and ſwagger. It was a witty ſpeech of Sir <hi>Tho. Moor</hi> that hee loved not to hear a <hi>vicious Prieſt</hi> recite his Creed, it made him ſuſpect his own faith, when ſuch a Prieſt ſaid his was the ſame. Give not thou occaſion to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to ſpeak reproachfully, becauſe a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170099:80"/> good profeſſion is not adorned with a holy and unblameable converſation.</p>
                  <p>The hypocrite is therefore no <hi>better friend</hi> to the Church and Truth, than the <hi>Heretick</hi> or <hi>Infidel;</hi> the <hi>Infidel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes</hi> againſt the truth, the hypocrite <hi>lives</hi> contrary to it, <hi>Infidelis contra ſcripturam diſputat, hypocrita vivit.</hi> The Heretick doth <hi>unica ſcriptura errare.</hi> The hypocrite doth <hi>toto coelo errare.</hi> The Heretick doth <hi>wreſt</hi> ſome <hi>one Scripture,</hi> the hypocrite doth <hi>reſiſt</hi> the whole Scripture to his own deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>In a word, ſome Heretick doubtleſs may bee ſaved, no hypocrite ever ſhall, yet am I ſo far from that (not ſo chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as looſe) opinion, that men may bee ſaved in all Religions, that I ſhall ſtraiten that very Poſition, <hi>Extra Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam nulla ſalus,</hi> no ſalvation to bee had out of the Church, and ſay, <hi>Intra Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam nulla ſalus hypocritis &amp; impiis,</hi> to hypocrites and ungodly ones, though orthodox, and living in the beſt Church, no univerſal ſalvation.</p>

The Lark ſpringing up by many degrees ſings a while, when at the higheſt, comes down all at once to the ground; or the Bullet, the higher it is ſhot upwards comes down more ſpeedily and violently. The children of the Kingdome are caſt into the worſt darkneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 12.

Oh <hi>Lucifer</hi> what a fall was thine! Oh hypocrites what a fall will this bee! Bee not high minded, but fear.

His tears come too late, or they are extorted, not kindly penitential tears flowing from a heart full of contrition and deteſtation of ſin. The hard marble ſometimes wee ſee ſtandeth on drops, and is all wet with tears, but it is againſt ſome weather, they are onely outward tears, the marble is nothing ſoftned when it weeps, they are cold tears, they are ſoon dried off again by change of weather, ſuch are the tears of hypocrites.</p>

Now an hypocrite may go up to the top of this <hi>Piſgah,</hi> and take a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170099:100"/> view of the land of promiſe before his death, yet never come nearer it, and ſee it no more. And then may that dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful lamentation bee taken up for him that is threatned to <hi>Babylon, The fruits that thy ſoul luſted after, are departed</hi>

As hee hath no trouble in his life, hee hath <hi>no bands in his death.</hi> Death ſeems rather bound than hee, and death more afraid of him, than hee of it.

And eſpecially if hee do conſider the ſeveral <hi>graces</hi> wherein he was defective, both <hi>preparatory, funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, nutritive, conſummative, and priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> or <hi>expulſive,</hi> that he falls ſhort in <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſelf-denial, ſin-mortification</hi> and <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> that he falls ſhort in a <hi>right faith, love, and hope</hi> (a <hi>working</hi> faith, <hi>labouring</hi> love, and <hi>patient</hi> hope) and eſpecially how he falls ſhort in <hi>integrity, integrality, perſeverance, &amp;c.</hi> Hee needs no other Glaſs, having had theſe three Glaſſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; yet becauſe theſe perſons, though they are <hi>Eagle-eyed</hi> to ſpy out others failings, are dim-ſighted in beholding themſelves, wee ſhall ſet before them two Glaſſes more. The <hi>one</hi> in this Chapter, wherein onely the hypocrites foul or painted face is plainly repreſented, and the <hi>other</hi> in the next Chapter, wherein two faces are to be ſeen together (the ſincere mans Glaſs) wherein the ſound Chriſtian may behold himſelf plainly, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion it gives the hypocrite a dark re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of himſelf.</p>
               <p>I read in <hi>Exodus,</hi> that the <hi>Laver</hi> of the Sanctuary was made of the womens <hi>Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſes;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Yet before I open this Glaſs, I ſhall premiſe <hi>two things</hi> by way of caution.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:170099:120"/> 1 Let no man think what is ſpoken here all along of the hypocrite, of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Profeſſors, or hypocriſie, is ſpoken to expoſe <hi>Profeſſion</hi> to reproach, &amp; to gratifie the humor of the prophane, who are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to catch hold of paſſages to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe they are not <hi>Profeſſors.</hi> And they think none are <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> but <hi>Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,</hi> and none Profeſſors but ſuch as <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat Sermons, pray, read, and ſing Pſalms</hi> in their families, &amp;c. And this they call <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and all Profeſſion they either count it <hi>ſingularity</hi> and unneceſſary <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſs,</hi> or plain <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> and becauſe they will bee ſure to hate hypocriſie, they diſclaim and hate Profeſſion. But diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and diſclaim <hi>Salvation,</hi> and all Chriſtianity too, <hi>For with the heart man beleeveth to righteouſneſs, and with the mouth confeſſion, or profeſsion is made unto ſalvation.</hi> But if thou wilt ſhew <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 10.</note> thy hatred to <hi>hypocriſie</hi> indeed, oppoſe it by <hi>ſincerity</hi> her profeſt enemy, and not by <hi>prophanenſs,</hi> which is not oppoſite to hypocriſie, but to <hi>piety.</hi> But I ſhall ſhew that many who run not after Sermons and are not ſtrict in the obſervation of the Lords day, &amp;c. are before they are aware as <hi>great Profeſſors</hi> as any others, and which is worſe, as <hi>great hypocrites</hi> as they are Profeſſors: Therefore ſpare thou to throw thy ſtone at firſt at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,

                  <q>Et tandem major parcas Inſane minori.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, hee that prayes that he may live a <hi>godly, righteous and a ſober life,</hi> prayes a good prayer, and makes a <hi>loud profeſsion</hi> in his recital of thoſe petitions, yet if hee do not live a <hi>ſober, righteous, and religious life,</hi> he will be loath to bee accounted an hypocrite.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He that prayes that thoſe things which he doth <hi>may pleaſe God, and that all the reſt of his life may bee pure and holy,</hi> ſteps far in the way of good <hi>praying and profeſsing,</hi> but if he have no care out of his devotions to <hi>pleaſe God,</hi> and be a ſcoffer at <hi>purity and holineſs</hi> in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, can there be any greater hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He who is a Witneſs or Surety at the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of an Infant, and being asked, <hi>Doeſt thou forſake the Devil, and all his works, the vain pomps, and deſires of the world, with all ſinful, and carnal luſts of the fleſh, ſo that thou wilt not follow, nor bee led by them?</hi> doth anſwer, <hi>I forſake them all.</hi> He maketh a good profeſſion I ſay, and is a <hi>great Profeſſor,</hi> as great as <hi>Saul,</hi> who <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 15.</note> ſaid, <hi>Come thou bleſſed of the Lord, I have done all that the Lord commanded mee,</hi> or as that young man who anſwered well for himſelf, <hi>All theſe have I kept from my</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, He who being examined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his faith, <hi>Doeſt thou beleeve, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:170099:121"/> hath his anſwer ready, <hi>All this I ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly beleeve.</hi> This is a high profeſſion; it is more than his who ſaid, <hi>Lord I beleeve, help my unbeleef.</hi> It is as much as his, who <note place="margin">Mark. 9. 24. Mat 19. 20.</note> ſaid, <hi>What lack I yet?</hi> And I doubt not, if there were more <hi>Interogatories</hi> put, they would get their anſwers ready; yet I fear mee, there be many of theſe, who tying other <hi>Profeſſors</hi> to the rules of their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion,</hi> and finding them fall ſhort, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them of <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> that if they ſhould try themſelves by theſe expreſſions of their own mouthes, muſt be forced to condemn themſelves when they cry out <hi>Hypocriſie, Hypocriſie,</hi> as <hi>Athaliah</hi> did, who cried out, <hi>Treaſon, Treaſon,</hi> when ſhee was the greateſt Traytor, and Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. <note place="margin">2 King. 11. 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, When at the <hi>Communion</hi> ſome admoniſhed by the Miniſter <hi>to lift up their hearts,</hi> preſently anſwer, <hi>Wee lift them up, and lift them up unto the Lord:</hi> What is here but great <hi>profeſsion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, to inſtance in no more, when upon your knees, in confeſſion of ſin, you ſay, <hi>The remembrance of our ſins is grievous unto us; The burden of them is into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, &amp;c.</hi> What is here but great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, holy and gracious expreſſions. But is the life, and the profeſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like?</p>
               <p>I ſpeak not this ſo much to finde any fault with thoſe wonted expreſſions in
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170099:121"/> our late <hi>Liturgy,</hi> as to ſhew thee thy fault, who denieſt thy ſelf to be a profeſſor, and yet makeſt as great a profeſſion as any man can do, and declaring againſt hypocriſie, and art thy ſelf (if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt judge impartially) the greateſt hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The <hi>ſecond Caution</hi> is, I ſpeak not of the hypocrites properties here, that thou ſhouldeſt learn and follow them, but as <hi>Solomon</hi> in deſcribing the Harlot, and her <note place="margin">Prov. 7. 25.</note> haunts and properties, that thou mayeſt avoid them. There is a Proverb I have read of the Pope, <hi>Hee that goeth once to Rome ſeeth a wicked man, hee that goeth the ſecond time, gets acquaintance with a wicked man, hee that goes the third time, brings him home with him.</hi> I would have the clean contrary here in them that ſhall look into theſe <hi>Glaſſes,</hi> at the firſt look, thou mayeſt ſee, and ſpy a wicked man, but at the ſecond look, be ſhie and jealous of him; and at the third, flye him, and get thee far from him, and leave him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 1. At the firſt bluſh, thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſee an hypocrite before thou lookeſt for him, and know him by his complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>If any man thinke himſelf Religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own ſoul, this mans Religion is vain.</hi> It <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 26.</note> is all hypocriſie: He that thinks he may be a Chriſtian, and yet a ſwearer, a ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170099:122"/> perſon, a ſcoffer, brawler, railer, reviler, backbiter, &amp;c. What doth his Religion mean? They make Religion nothing but an empty notion. Doth this bleating and bellowing of ſuch ſhew that they have done all that the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth? It is not for the Chriſtian to ſay, <hi>My tongue is my own,</hi> my heart is the <note place="margin">Pſal. 12. 4. Rom. 7. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Lords;</hi> with my <hi>minde I ſerve the Law of God, but with my fleſh</hi> and tongue <hi>the Law of ſin,</hi> as he excuſed his idle Poems.

               <p>So many plead, I talk merrily, mean no hurt, my heart is as good as the beſt: I anſwer, the <hi>good communication</hi> ſhews the <hi>good heart,</hi> and the good treaſure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 34, 35.</note> ſay as well the tree is good, though fruit bad; the ſpring ſweet, though water bitter, as to ſay my heart is ſound, though ſpeech rotten and unſavoury. The ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breath comes not from the tongue or mouth, but from within, and ſhews the inwards not to be ſound; thy ſtinking communication doth the like. Not onely doth <hi>Grammar</hi> begin at <hi>In Speech,</hi> but <hi>Grace.</hi> Some have ſaid, He that would learn to <hi>thrive,</hi> let him begin at his <hi>mouth;</hi> I ſay, and <hi>David</hi> ſaith, He that would learn to <hi>live,</hi> Pſal. 34. 12, 13. Either therefore make the tree and fruit, heart and ſpeech both good, or elſe for ſhame,

               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 2. When thou ſeeſt a man onely curious and Religious in his diſcourſe (on the other ſide) and regardleſs of his heart and actions, here is a <hi>groſs Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite</hi> again, none can deny. Such a one is ever more careful of his <hi>ſpeech,</hi> than of his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> hee looks more to his <hi>lips,</hi> than to his <hi>life;</hi> His ſpeech is with <hi>grace,</hi> his ſpirit <hi>without grace;</hi> his ſpeech ſeaſoned with <hi>ſalt,</hi> his ſpirit <hi>unſavoury</hi> and <hi>unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.

               <p>The ſuperſtitious <hi>Jews</hi> at their Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, were more nice and ſcrupulous about coming into the <hi>Pratorium,</hi> and defiling themſelves with the company of a <hi>Heathen perſon,</hi> than about crucifying <note place="margin">Jo. 18. 28.</note> the Son of God.

               <p>It is obſervable, there are two great <hi>Congregators,</hi> and <hi>Uniters</hi> in Nature, <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold; Heat</hi> congregates and unites <hi>homogeneous</hi> things, and diſgregates <hi>heterogeneous</hi> as wee ſay: As the fire congregates the pure mettal together, and ſeparates the droſs from it.

               <p>I Come from the Hypocrites, to the <hi>Sincere</hi> Chriſtians Glaſs.

And moſt remarkable of all it is, that when as the Philiſtims carried the Ark on a Cart, it made up the breach. But when <hi>David</hi> would have it carried on a Cart, a ſad breach followed.

As to <hi>example,</hi> he dare not make the <hi>moſt</hi> or <hi>greateſt</hi> his example, but the <hi>beſt.</hi> And in following the very <hi>beſt</hi> examples, hee conſtantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves theſe four following Rules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 1. To pick out the very <hi>beſt</hi> of men, ſome choice ones only for his examples; <hi>Brethren hee followers together of mee, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>marke them that walke ſo, as you have us for an example.</hi> And therefore if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age afford not fit preſidents, he looks back to ages paſt, as <hi>Jehoſhaphat, Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, Joſiah, &amp;c.</hi> walked in the wayes of <hi>David</hi> their Father. He reckons it a good rule with him, <hi>Uti verbis &amp; nummis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentibus, vivere moribus praeteritis,</hi> to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170099:140"/> make uſe of ſuch mony and words, as are currant at preſent, but of ſuch examples and manners as were in uſe in times paſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 2. His ſecond Rule is in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>beſt,</hi> to pick out <hi>the Beſt of the Beſt,</hi> the moſt imitable part of all their acts and lives, as <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> picked out <hi>David</hi> for a pattern, and the <hi>first part</hi> of <hi>Davids</hi> life for his ſamplar or copy. <hi>Hee walked in the firſt wayes of David his father,</hi> it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 3.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Examples</hi> there may and muſt bee <hi>picking,</hi> and <hi>chuſing,</hi> whom to follow, and what to follow, though in <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements</hi> there muſt bee neither picking nor chuſing, but all muſt bee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
               <p>Now the actions of Beſt men may bee referred to three ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Some are <hi>deviations</hi> from the Rule, and <hi>falling ſhort</hi> (though wee call them <hi>Tranſgreſſions</hi> (improperly enough) they are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſinfull and irregular <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,</hi> and exorbitancies, deficiencies) ſuch was <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery, which fell ſhort of, or ſwarved from the Rule, and Law of chaſtity.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Some of their <hi>acts</hi> as much <hi>exceeded,</hi> and went beyond the ordinary Rule, and were in them commendable (or not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull) which would become ſinfull to us if wee ſhould do the like by vertue of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170099:140"/> their example, without any particular warrant. Such was that act of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſacrificing his Son, <hi>Elias</hi> calling for <hi>fire</hi> from heaven: The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 10. 2 King. 1. 10. Ex. 12. 35.</note> of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Theſe in us would become Tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Some of their acts had a due <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> to the Rule, and theſe onely are for imitation; ſuch was <hi>Davids piety, zeal, integrity</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>loyalty</hi> towards his <hi>Sovereigne, fidelity</hi> to his <hi>friends,</hi> as <hi>Jonathan</hi> eſpecially, <hi>clemency</hi> to enemies, as <hi>Shemis</hi> for inſtance, &amp;c. Theſe I ſay onely are for our imitation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 3. The beſt examples muſt bee followed alwayes with this <hi>Restriction,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 1. <hi>Bee yee followers of mee, as I am alſo of Chriſt.</hi> If wee are ſure our neighbour ſet his Clock by the Sun, wee may ſafely ſet our Watch by his Clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 4. The beſt examples muſt ever bee followed with this <hi>Addition</hi> alſo, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Yee became followers of us, and of the Lord.</hi> Of us, though Apoſtles, holy teachers and livers, is not enough; <hi>But of us and the Lord:</hi> This makes all up.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Hee is afraid of <hi>appearances of evill,</hi> and of appearances of <hi>good</hi> both, but which you would little expect, hee <hi>fears</hi> and ſuſpects the appearance of <hi>good more; Abſtain from all appearance of evill,</hi>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:170099:141"/> 1 Theſſ. 5. 21. But hee abhors onely the <hi>appearance of good,</hi> where there is no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.</hi>

               <p n="21">21 In the next place, which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted note of ſincerity, hee is oft <hi>with himſelf,</hi> deſirous to <hi>examine</hi> and know himſelf, and oft <hi>with God,</hi> deſirous that he would examine and try him: And Gods examination hee deſires much more than his own, as not daring to truſt himſelf. Hee oft judgeth, and examineth himſelfe, hee puts all the hard <hi>queſtions</hi> and <hi>doubts</hi> hee can by <hi>communing with his own heart,</hi> and making diligent ſearch (a <hi>privy</hi> ſearch) in his ſpirit, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, and he <note place="margin">Pſal. 77. 6.</note> handles his conſcience <hi>roughly,</hi> as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did his brethren at firſt, fearing there was yet no change, to finde out what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is, and though he liſtens to what is ſaid of him abroad, yet if it be good, he dare not take up ſo. <hi>Nec te quaeſiveris extra.</hi> One teſtimony of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is to him above <hi>a thouſand wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> but the teſtimony of God is to him above a <hi>thouſand conſciences,</hi> therefore he often prayes, <hi>Lord examine me, and prove mee, try my reines, and my heart, ſee if there bee any way of wickedneſs in mee</hi> (for I much ſuſpect my ſelf) <hi>and lead mee in the way everlaſting,</hi> Pſal. 26. 2. and 139. 23, 24.</p>

               <p n="24">24 In a word to conclude, as <hi>to ſin,</hi> hee is afraid, oft watcheth and prayeth againſt <hi>one and all,</hi> but <hi>one</hi> eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>all,</hi> and that is <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> Job 17. 8.

               </p>
               <p>So that if thou comeſt in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thou art ſafe enough; which coming muſt bee</p>
               <p>1 A ſincere and honeſt coming; <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniels</hi> was ſuch a coming, of whom when Chriſt ſaw him come, hee ſaith, Lo here is a man for mee, <hi>Behold an Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite indeed in whom is no guile.</hi> All <note place="margin">10. 1. 47.</note> other comings without this are nothing.

               <p>2 The next right coming to Chriſt is the <hi>diligent and inquiſitive</hi> coming (not a lazy coming as was ſaid before, as that

               <p>Such was the coming and ſeeking of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> who having miſſed her and our Saviour, ſought for him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all her friends, and with much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for three dayes, that ſhee could not hear of him, ſhee comes to the <hi>Temple,</hi> and <hi>where</hi> ſhould ſhee finde him, but <hi>there?</hi> And <hi>among whom,</hi> but the <hi>Doctors,</hi> and <hi>Teachers?</hi> And <hi>what doing,</hi> but <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>

Men do not ſleightly ſeek a treaſure, but lay out for it, and part with all for it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 44.</p>
               <p>You read <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. of the great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs</hi> of the world with what eagerneſs and diligence they purſue earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,

They do not dream or <hi>creep</hi> when earthly Kingdomes are to bee looked after, but they run of all <hi>foure,</hi> and foure <hi>legs</hi> are too little, they want <hi>wings,</hi> and <hi>two</hi> wings are too few, they muſt have <hi>foure.</hi> And as that filthy beaſt in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> that had <hi>ſeven heads,</hi> and <hi>ten horns,</hi> doth lay out all the <note place="margin">Rev. 13. 1.</note> policy of <hi>ſeven heads,</hi> and all the power of the <hi>ten Hornes,</hi> to enlarge his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Power: So it is with the godly ſoul, if hee had <hi>ſeven heads,</hi> and <hi>ten hearts,</hi> all ſhould bee imployed to ſeek out Chriſt, and to gain him.</p>
               <p>But oh! That wee were but as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in ſeeking Chriſt, as <hi>Saul</hi> and his ſervants were in ſeeking the <hi>loſt Aſſes,</hi> yea <note place="margin">1 Sam. 10. 4.</note> as the woman her <hi>Groat,</hi> nay it is a ſhame it ſhould bee ſaid, <hi>(Et dici potuiſſe, &amp; non potuiſſe refelli.)</hi> As the <hi>Drunkard</hi> ſeeks his <hi>cups</hi> after hee hath ſmarted already. <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 37.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Or the <hi>unclean ſpirit</hi> gone out of the man goeth <hi>through dry places, ſeeking reſt;</hi> yea as the unclean ſpirit not gone out of <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 43.</note> the <hi>woman,</hi> after her peace-offering, ſets her upon the ſeeking of her companion, <hi>and diligently ſhe tells him ſhe ſought till ſhe found him.</hi> Oh that <hi>Hell</hi> ſhould have <note place="margin">Prov. 7. 15.</note> ſo many <hi>ſeekers</hi> and <hi>puchaſers,</hi> and Chriſt and heaven none.</p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:170099:164"/>
               <p> Alas wee ſeek Chriſt as the young <note place="margin">2 King. 2. 17.</note> men ſought <hi>Elias</hi> body, if not finde it in <hi>three dayes</hi> ſpace give it over, or as <hi>Elias</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 18. 43, 44.</note> 
                  <hi>ſervant,</hi> when ſent to ſee what hee could diſcover in the skye, and ſeeing nothing, returns preſently, impatient of waiting; but wee ſhould do as <hi>Elias, ſend and ſend again,</hi> pray, wait, look, till wee ſee heaven full of clouds, and thoſe clouds of ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, giving a joyfull anſwer, and return to all our prayers and hopes.</p>
               <p>A lively example of this coming unto Chriſt, wee have in the Wiſe-men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 1, 2. who ſpared no pains to finde a Saviour, they left their native Country, and ſet their <hi>faces</hi> towards <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the <hi>Star</hi> which firſt drew them out; at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they inquire of the <hi>Scribes and Prieſts,</hi> theſe inquire at the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and direct them to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> thither they go directed by Prieſts and Scripture, and the diſ-appearing Star breaks out again, and to Chriſt they come. All this was not without a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. It was to ſhew us firſt that none come to Chriſt till divinely inlightned and acted: A Star appeared firſt, then God having appointed Miniſters to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal Chriſt, they muſt bee ſought to for further direction: The Miniſter can go no further than the Scripture; To the <hi>Law and Teſtimony</hi> hee muſt go, and that is your way to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> but you muſt
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170099:164"/> look up for the Star again, <hi>Divine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and manuduction,</hi> or Miniſters and Scripture cannot bring you to Chriſt. Neither <hi>Revelations</hi> without <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor <hi>they</hi> without that <hi>ſpirit of Revelation,</hi> which the Apoſtle prayes for, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 17. are ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Then 3. The next is the humble coming. The Centurions coming, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>Non ſum dignus, I am not worthy,</hi> ſaid hee, <hi>Thou ſhouldeſt come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my roof.</hi> The more unworthy in thy own account, the more worthy in Gods account.

               </p>
               <p>The humble <hi>Saviour,</hi> and the humble <hi>ſinner,</hi> are alwayes well met, and rejoyce mutually as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> when they <note place="margin">Exod. 4. 14.</note> ſaw each other; you will not beleeve how far Chriſt Jeſus would go to meet an humble ſoul.</p>
               <p>4 The fourth coming is the <hi>ſpeedy coming,</hi> and the <hi>ſpeedy coming</hi> is alway the <hi>ſpeeding coming. Zacheus</hi> his coming,

                  <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 5, 6. <hi>Make haſte Zacheus, and come down, for I muſt dine at thy houſe this day, and hee made haſte, and came down, and received him joyfully.</hi> A rare and happy coming, hee comes at firſt call, hee doth what hee is bidden, and more, Chriſt bids him <hi>come,</hi> hee <hi>comes,</hi> hee bids come <hi>preſently,</hi> and hee comes <hi>ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> but Chriſt tells him hee will but <hi>dine</hi> with him, and hee ſaith, that thou ſhalt <hi>with all my heart, and in my heart,</hi> Chriſt ſaith nothing of <hi>forſaking all,</hi> and <hi>giving to the poor</hi> as to the <hi>young man,</hi> or making reſtitution. But this comes of himſelf when hee hath once entertained Chriſt: So that here are three things notable in his coming.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2 This coming was <hi>backed with a recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he <hi>received him joyfully</hi> into his <hi>houſe,</hi> and into his <hi>heart</hi> too, <hi>Chriſtum hominem &amp; Chriſtum Meſſiam,</hi> the <hi>man</hi> Chriſt into his <hi>houſe,</hi> and Chriſt the <hi>Meſsias</hi> into his <hi>heart.</hi> Hee was <hi>hoſpes, &amp; hoſpes, &amp; epulae Chriſti.</hi> The <hi>Hoſt</hi> and <hi>Gueſt,</hi> and <hi>feaſt</hi>

               <p>There are <hi>two great comings</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Chriſt propheſied of in Scripture, and two great <hi>mourning dayes,</hi> and both theſe fall out on the dayes of his appearing. His firſt coming is in a <hi>day of grace,</hi> when all the <hi>families of Iſrael</hi> mourn as for an onely Son, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. The <hi>ſecond mourning</hi> is at his <hi>ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> when all the <hi>kindreds and families of the earth</hi> ſhall <hi>mourn,</hi> becauſe of him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 7.</p>

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:170099:167"/> in which is the Rain-bow to bee ſeen, the token of the Covenant. This I may call the <hi>ſigne of the Son of man</hi> coming in the <hi>clouds</hi> of Grace. The other mourning is like the unceſſant mourning of the heavens in the <hi>Winter months,</hi> when there is continual rain and cold withall, but no fruitfulneſs. Then ſhall the <hi>heavens melt,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 10.</note> and mourn and <hi>paſs away with a noyſe,</hi> and bee no more, and <hi>earth,</hi> and <hi>hell</hi> ſhall melt and mourn too, but not <hi>paſs away</hi> at all, but <hi>paſs away eternity</hi> with a hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and inceſſant <hi>noyſe, ſtridore dentium, fletu &amp; gemitu, weeping, wayling, and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>

               <p n="4">4 <hi>A mans own will</hi> is the <hi>fourth wheel,</hi> and hath his <hi>act</hi> and <hi>turn</hi> too: It is not the <hi>onely</hi> wheel as ſome will have it, nor the <hi>firſt</hi> wheel, but the very <hi>laſt</hi> wheel; it hath onely <hi>motum ſequacem &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctum,</hi> a motion of <hi>concomitance,</hi> as the other orbs are by the prime mover; or as the wheels in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> moved along with the motion of the Spirit that acted them, <note place="margin">Ezek. 1. 20.</note> ſo is this wheel by the former wheels.</p>
               <p>Thy own will left to it ſelf will not bring thee to Chriſt, thy will will keep

               <p>I ſpeak the more largely of this, that
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:170099:178"/> wee may the better know whether wee have yet come to Chriſt, or no. Now as when the Lord ſaith, <hi>Make you a new heart; Turn you, turn you, why will you dye?</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, If thou canſt not ſay, Thou haſt <hi>ever yet come to Chriſt</hi> in theſe former
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:170099:179"/> comings, thou canſt not ſay, Thou ever cameſt <hi>humbly, penitently, beleevingly, ſelf-deſpairingly, importunately, &amp;c.</hi> or that ever thou waſt <hi>drawn to him,</hi> as I ſaid even now, thy caſe is <hi>ſad</hi> I confeſs, yet not <hi>deſperate.</hi> I have one word to ſay to thee yet ere I have done, to thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Hee that hath ears to hear, let him hear, hee that can receive this ſaying, let him receive it. <hi>Deſpair not,</hi> no mans caſe is <hi>utterly deſperate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is one more coming yet, the laſt, the <hi>late coming,</hi> the coming of the <hi>Theef on the Croſs;</hi> come yet to Chriſt, come <hi>judging thy ſelfe, condemning thy ſelfe,</hi> ſuing for mercy, and caſt thy ſelfe upon Chriſt (there is a <hi>poſſibility</hi> yet left, and ſome hopes that thou mayeſt bee ſafe; but I ſpeak not ſo certainly and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently here as upon the former comings) This was the late coming of the Theef upon the Croſs, hee had never been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before, nor haply heard of a Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but now when death was upon him, and his ſin heavier than death, hee <hi>looks up</hi> to a crucified Saviour, <hi>judging himſelf,</hi> rebuking his railing companion, <hi>confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 23. 40, 41, 42.</note> Chriſt when all the Diſciples had left him, and caſting himſelf upon his mercy, <hi>Lord remember mee when thou comeſt into thy Kingdome.</hi> I ſay there is yet a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for thee.</p>
               <p>This <hi>example</hi> is written for our <hi>conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:170099:179"/> that none ſhould <hi>deſpaire;</hi> yet have wee but one ſuch example in all the Scripture leſt any ſhould <hi>preſume.</hi> And of this Scripture wee may ſay as much as of any one other, wicked and ungodly men have perverted it to their <hi>own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But very obſervable it is, that though all the four Evangeliſts ſpeak largely of our Saviours paſſion, and mention his ſuffering between two Theeves, yet one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of them (St. <hi>Luke)</hi> mentions the converſion of the Theef. The Holy Ghoſt fore-ſaw what ill uſe might bee made thereof, therefore thought fit it ſhould bee but ſparingly ſet down. But is this a good Argument? <hi>Elias</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up into heaven in a <hi>Chariot of fire, ergo,</hi> I may bee ſo too. There were many Prophets in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> only <hi>Elias</hi> was ſo taken up to heaven. <hi>Many Lepers in Iſrael</hi> in <note place="margin">Luke 4. 25, 26. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Eliſhaes</hi> dayes. A Syrian was cleanſed, but not one of them. <hi>One Widow</hi> relieved miraculouſly by <hi>Elias</hi> when there were many others that famiſhed. But I may as well retort this Argument and turn it upon thee: There were two Theeves crucified with Chriſt, the one ſaw Chriſt dye, heard him pray, &amp;c. ſaw the other Theef repenting, yet hee repented not, <hi>as hee lived, hee dyed;</hi> a <hi>Blaſphemer</hi> hee <hi>lived,</hi> a Blaſphemer hee dyed; hee lived <hi>denying</hi> God, dyed <hi>deſpiſing</hi> Chriſt; ſo mayeſt
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:170099:180"/> thou: Thus dyed he, and it was juſt with God to <hi>leave</hi> him at his <hi>death,</hi> who had <hi>left</hi> God all his <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have heard of one taken out of the <hi>belly of hell, Jonah</hi> ſo calls the Whales <note place="margin">Ionah 2. 2</note> belly, where he had been three dayes, and three nights in great diſtreſs, you never read of a ſecond; and I know the Papiſts ſpeak of one <hi>Trajan</hi> delivered out of hell it ſelf by the prayers of <hi>Gregory;</hi> and one <hi>Falconella,</hi> by the prayers of <hi>Tecla.</hi> But all theſe caſes were extraordinary and miraculous, and not to be expected every day. This dreaming of late repentance, hath ſlain not <hi>his Thouſands,</hi> but his <hi>ten Thouſands.</hi> Therefore I do not ſay <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi> if thou comeſt in the laſt hour thou ſhalt be ſafe; All that I can ſay is, there may be ſome good <hi>hopes.</hi> The other former comings are the ſafe comings. The <hi>ſhorteſt</hi> and <hi>eaſieſt</hi> way to Heaven is not the ſafeſt.
